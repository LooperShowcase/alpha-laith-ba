      Tesla, Inc. (/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə or /ˈtɛzlə/ TEZ-lə[b]) is an American
      electric vehicle and clean energy company based in Palo Alto, California,
      United States. Tesla designs and manufactures electric cars, battery
      energy storage from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles,
      and related products and services. Tesla is one of the world's most
      valuable companies and remains the most valuable automaker in the world
      with a market cap of nearly $1 trillion. The company had the most sales of
      battery electric vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles, capturing 16% of
      the plug-in market (which includes plug-in hybrids) and 23% of the
      battery-electric (purely electric) market. Through its subsidiary Tesla
      Energy, the company develops and is a major installer of photovoltaic
      systems in the United States. Tesla Energy is also one of the largest
      global suppliers of battery energy storage systems, with 3 gigawatt-hours
      (GWh) installed in 2020. Founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc
      Tarpenning as Tesla Motors, the company's name is a tribute to inventor
      and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a US$6.5
      million investment, X.com co-founder Elon Musk became the largest
      shareholder of the company and its chairman. He has served as CEO since
      2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move
      to sustainable transport and energy, obtained through electric vehicles
      and solar power. Tesla began production of its first car model, the
      Roadster, in 2009. This was followed by the Tesla Model S sedan in 2012,
      the Tesla Model X SUV in 2015, the Tesla Model 3 sedan in 2017, and the
      Tesla Model Y crossover in 2020. The Tesla Model 3 is the all-time
      best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide, and, in June 2021, became the
      first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[8] Tesla's global
      vehicle sales were 499,550 units in 2020, a 35.8% increase over the
      previous year. In October 2021, Tesla's market capitalization reached US$1
      trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S. history. Tesla has been the
      subject of several lawsuits and controversies arising from statements and
      acts of CEO Elon Musk and from allegations of creative accounting,
      whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations, and unresolved and
      dangerous technical problems with their products. In September 2021, the
      National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ordered Tesla to
      submit data pertaining to all sold US vehicles equipped with Autopilot.
